# deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter

## Overview

This module adds ONNX conversion of `deform_conv2d` to support the export.

At this moment, in August 2021, PyTorch 1.9.0 and torchvision 0.10.0 does not support exporting `deform_conv2d` into ONNX.  
This module enables to export `deform_conv2d`.

This module implements Deformable Convolution v2, described in a paper, `Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168>`, using ONNX operators.  
The implementation is straightforward, but may not be efficient.

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter
```

## Usage

```python
import torch.onnx
from torchvision.ops.deform_conv import DeformConv2d
import deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter

deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter.register_deform_conv2d_onnx_op()

model = DeformConv2d(...)
input_names = ["input", "offset"]
output_names = ["output"]
torch.onnx.export(model,
                  input_params,
                  "output.onnx",
                  input_names=input_names,
                  output_names=output_names,
                  opset_version=12)
```

Note that you have to set `opset_version` to `12` or later.
